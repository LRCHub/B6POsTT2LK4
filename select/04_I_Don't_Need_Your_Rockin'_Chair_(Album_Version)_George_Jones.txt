Chorus:
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
Well I still got Neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
Well I don't need your rockin' chair

I ain't ready for the junkyard yet
Cause I still feel like a new corvette
It might take a little longer but I'll get there
Well I don't need your rockin' chair

Chorus:
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
Well I still got Neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
Well I don't need this rockin' chair

Retirement don't fit in my plans
You can keep your seat I'm a gonna stand
An Eskimo needs a Fridgedaire
Like I need your rockin' chair

Chorus:
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
Well I still got Neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
Well I don't need your rockin' chair

My body's old but it ain't impaired
Well I don't need your rockin' chair... Uh Huh...
